# Profitable Apps Dataset
Data analyst project for a company which creates Android and iOS mobile apps, available on the Google Play and App Store. The company only builds apps that are free to download and install, and their main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. 

This means that the number of users of apps determines the revenue for any given app â€” the more users who see and engage with the ads, the better. The goal for this project is to analyze data to help the developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users.

## Guided Project Info
This is a guided project from dataquest.io. I've tweaked the project to include the numpy and pandas libraries, some functions to ease the access to data, and other libraries for data visualization and graphing (to be included later).
